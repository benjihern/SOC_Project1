Project 1 Description

Import a Pong IP within Vivado and write to specific LED registers to display the game score on a 7-segment display. 

I faced many problems throughout this lab. Importing the files into Vivado was easy, however I faced issues when moving over to Vitis. I was having trouble generating a platform due to not having the correct Vivado block design. I failed to include the microblaze and Uart component in order to run the Hello World code. After this I had to install certain drivers and move around some pin components on my board to get it working properly and so that it was detected by my laptop. Finally, I had some issues with the .xdc file. I could not get my enable signals to work on the display.  

I learned the steps towards creating an embedded systems project and how it works at a basic level. I learned that it takes a lot of time and effort to even make the simplest of projects. I became familiar with Vitis and Vivado, and how to make them work together to create a project. I learned that compiling and testing projects takes a while, so looking out for errors beforehand is key for saving time.
